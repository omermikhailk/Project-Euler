# Project Euler Solutions

My solutions for the Project Euler problems. All the solutions are in Python.


### Commits and issues

All commit messages should ideally be prefaced with `#<commit number for file>` eg. `#3. Changed output of the movies() function to a sorted list of movies instead of unsorted.`.

And for issues they should be prefaced with `<num>.`. Eg. `5. The movies() function does not properly sort the list of movies alphabetically.`.
