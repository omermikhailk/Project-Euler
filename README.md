# Project Euler Solutions

My solutions for the Project Euler problems. All the solutions are in Python.


### Commits and issues

All commit messages should be written like:

```
7. Optimise multiplying_polynomial() function

The function does not work for polynomials which are higher
than degree four.

Resolves: #3
```

In this the resolves bar at the bottom will reference to
whether a commit resolves a certain issue or not.


Similarly all issues should be opened like:

```
Polynomial multiplier function does not handle inputs
of larger than degree 4
```
